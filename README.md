# Random Python Projects

## Description

A collection of random python projects to keep myself from getting bored

  

## Current Projects:

 - Security
	 - [Caesar Cypher](https://github.com/JaINTP/Random-Python-Projects/blob/main/Security/caesar_cipher.py)
	 A basic, and probably bad implementation of the [Ceasar Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
 - Utilities
	 - [Console Window](https://github.com/JaINTP/Random-Python-Projects/blob/main/Utilities/console_window.py)
	 A simple curses based console wrapper that shows a title bar at the top, a status bar at the bottom and all other output in the centre.
